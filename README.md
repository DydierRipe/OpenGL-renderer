<h1>Hi This is for you to see before u critiquize </h1>

A lot of code is super inefficient and provisional, most part of that code is marked as <b>"LEGACY"</b> or is on onUpdate. 
Renderer class and file is super disordered and a lot of the code is just legacy made.
Code will improve a lot when Map class is minimally finished <b>(the same will happen with GLSL code)</b> but for now, this is what I've got :)

<s>This is also lacking of comments, but that'll be fixed soon</s>

You can suggest whatever on my media (reach me just as dydierripe on any social media or via whatsapp if u somehow got my number)

<h2>Specs (yeah this somehow exists)</h2>

here will be something written
